My happiest moment was in 2007 at the day of 12 th result, It was happiest moment beacuse i had faced lot of challange and hardship at that year.
I like to mention here some of the hardship.
1 st was my brother son had got accident and he was remain in coma for three months,so it was very difficult to manage school,work,and hospital.
2 nd was as i was working and studying at jamme away from home,so at tim of exam lot of pressure on me to manage work load and exam.
So continous with all this I was remain calm and focused with the littlle bit time I was get for study ,and got good reward for this.
so my 12 class result day was my happiest moment beacuse i passed with good precentage
