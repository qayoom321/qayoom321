|⑻|**Description**|I had already experince of shopping with amazon ,but my previous experince was with cash on delivery.At january 2020 I have choose redmi 8 pro with discount price.I have compare price with flipkart and other and there price is very highas compare with amazon.So i have no option and book the mobile with advance payment with debit card.I am very confused if i get the mobile or not and if I get anything else in place of mobile.But I received my order after two days of booking instead of one week.**I recommend every one must try amazon once**.|
